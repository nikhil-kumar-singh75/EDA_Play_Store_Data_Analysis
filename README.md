# EDA-Play_Store_Data_Analysis

In this project we made EDA project on Play Store App Review Analysis and in this project we tried to analyse some of the business problems and tried find the answer to all those business problems.
1. First we tried to read the two csv files which were provided to us i.e.Play Store data.csv and User Reviews.csv
2. Then we look through those csv files.
3. Then we have performed data cleaning on the datasets.
4. Then we have performed data wrangling with these datasets.
5. Then we analysed the data and found the solutions using data visualization techniques.
